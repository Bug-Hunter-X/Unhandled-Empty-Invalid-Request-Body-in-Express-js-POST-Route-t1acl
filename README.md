# Unhandled Empty/Invalid Request Body in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where POST requests with empty or invalid bodies are not properly handled, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Bug

The bug lies in the `/users` POST route.  If a client sends a request with an empty or malformed JSON body, the server will not gracefully handle it.  Depending on the framework's internal error handling, this might result in a server error (500) or simply an unexpected response.

## Solution

The solution involves adding input validation and error handling.  This ensures the server responds appropriately to invalid requests, preventing unexpected behavior and crashes.
